										<p>
											Oladipo Adebayo Ebiesuwa, (pka Praiseaddict), is a dedicated worship and praise leader with a longstanding commitment to the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) since 1998. He began his journey as a choir member in the children and teens' choir, progressing into the main adult choir.
											Praiseaddict's musical journey was nurtured from an early stage under the guidance of his first music director, Funmilayo Idowu. In 2005, he furthered his musical education through a collaboration between RCCG LPXI and The Musical Society of Nigeria (Muson) Centre. Additionally, he had the privilege of participating in "Voice it Out," a music (voice) masterclass facilitated by renowned vocal coach Segun Obe. This opportunity, sponsored twice by his then-pastor, Pastor Danjuma Tafawa-Balewa, provided him with invaluable tutelage from esteemed music artists such as Tim Godfrey, Onos Ariyo, Timi Dakolo, and Segun Obe, among others.
											During his tenure as a teenage music director at RCCG LPXI, Adebayo demonstrated a track record of training church members in the foundational principles of music, including music theory and instrument proficiency. He continued this work at various RCCG branches, including Glorious Chapel, LPXI, Cornerstone Parish (My Father's House), LP 15 Headquarters, and the Redeemed Christian Fellowship (RCF) at Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba (AAUA) Chapter during his university years.
											Praiseaddict's unwavering dedication to music stems from his fervent desire to offer the highest quality musical worship to God on every possible occasion. This commitment birthed "Music4All", a platform aimed at simplifying the understanding of music fundamentals for musicians of all levels.</p>
