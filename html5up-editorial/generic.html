									<h2>Minister Sam (MS)
										MD, RCCG, LP15</h2>
									<p>I highly recommend Adebayo, an exceptional learner with the potential to become an outstanding teacher. Over the past decade as a member of the Choir I direct, he has demonstrated remarkable learning capabilities, swiftly mastering new skills, particularly in sight-reading and classical music. This proficiency led me to entrust him with special responsibilities.
										Adebayo's knowledge of musical instruments is impressive. Although he does not play the piano, he possesses a solid understanding of it. He excels as a trumpeter and drummer, showcasing his versatility. Additionally, Adebayo is a talented singer with a rich vocal texture, consistently leading worship/praise in a manner that evidently brings the congregation before God.
										His songwriting is equally commendable, with his compositions reflecting both skill and inspiration. Adebayo writes with a distinctive grace and anointing that sets his work apart.
										Above all, Adebayo is a devout individual with a profound relationship with God. His commitment and reverence for God are evident in his demeanor and speech. He embodies the qualities of a dedicated musician and worship leader, making every interaction with him a positive and enriching experience.
										Adebayo exemplifies the ideal musician and church singer/instrumentalist, and I am confident that he will excel in any teaching role he undertakes.

									<h2>Olasoji Oluwa
										MD, RCCG, LP3 Annex 2</h2>
									<p>I first met Mr. Oladipo Adebayo Ebiesuwa (Praiseaddict) in 2005 when I joined the RCCG adult choir under the direction of Mrs. Funmi Idowu.
										Brother Bayo, as we fondly called him, was instrumental in my initial music education. He generously shared his music notebooks with me and introduced me to the fundamentals of music, such as teaching me how to identify the key note of a song.
										I was immediately inspired by his passion for God and his musical talent. He demonstrated a commitment to excellence in his craft, strong leadership, and a genuinely good character. His dedication to God and to providing quality music in the church has remained steadfast over the years.
										It is an honor to be invited by him to support this remarkable initiative that he has been divinely inspired to undertake.

									<h2>Emmanuel Yeku (Ejazz)
										Pianist</h2>
									<p>Adebayo, also known as Praiseaddict, is a musical virtuoso whose talents extend far beyond vocal performance. He excels as a praise worship leader and lead vocalist, an exceptional backup singer, a skilled trumpeter, and an adept drummer, all underpinned by a comprehensive understanding of music fundamentals. His sight-reading ability is unparalleled.
										Having worked with Adebayo for over eight years, I can attest to his remarkable musical acumen, proficiency, and professionalism.
